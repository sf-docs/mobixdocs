The system contains a certain set of requirements and a certain set of defect types. As mentioned above, there are certain types of defects associated with each requirement, and if they are found in the application, the requirement will be considered as not met.

To see which defect types are associated with a requirement and/or to associate a new defect type to a requirement, select that requirement. On the right side you will see a list of defects already associated with it and a field for selecting new defect types.

<figure markdown>![](../ug/img/50.png)</figure>At the top right of the **Defects** area in the **Select a defect to add** field, you can select one of the available defect types in the system from the drop-down list. The newly selected defect type will be added to the list of defects associated with this requirement.
