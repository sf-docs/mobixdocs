## Project List

The **Projects** page lists all existing projects in this company and their scan profiles.

For each project, its name, package name and application architecture are shown. On this page you can find brief information about existing project profiles, number of defects found over the lifetime of the project, number of scans performed, date of the last scan, and number of modules enabled.

You can also add a new project or add a new scan profile for an existing project.

Clicking on the project name opens the project page with general information and three tabs: **Profiles**, **Rules**, and **Access**.

## Project Information

The top of the project page provides general project information, including:

* Project avatar.
